## üìñ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **Flutter web app** that supports **real-time audio/video communication**. The app is designed to be **responsive**, ensuring compatibility across multiple screen sizes and devices, and was built within a tight **one-week deadline**. 

### Key Features:
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Enabled by WebRTC for seamless video and audio streams.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Firebase Deployment**: Hosted for live user access and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

The development was structured over five days, with a focus on iterative progress:

### Day 1: Environment Setup
- Installed Flutter SDK and WebRTC dependencies.
- Configured the development environment and IDE.
- Reviewed WebRTC API documentation.

### Day 2: Core Functionality Development
- Created the app structure with integrated WebRTC features.
- Configured signaling servers for real-time communication.

### Day 3: UI/UX Design
- Designed a professional, responsive user interface with Flutter widgets.
- Implemented interactive call buttons and video preview sections.

### Day 4: Testing and Debugging
- Conducted unit tests for WebRTC features.
- Resolved UI rendering and stream synchronization issues.
- Performed cross-device compatibility checks.

### Day 5: Optimization and Deployment
- Optimized code for performance and latency.
- Deployed the app to **Firebase Hosting**.
- Prepared a demo video showcasing the app.
